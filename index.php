			Okay, so perhaps not precisely the month of May, but starting in late April there's been a spat of recalls attributable to Listeria in Canada and the United States. Looking at the CFIA recall listings for the first 10 days of May:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2016-05-09b/eng/1462850202306/1462850205064">Food Recall Warning - Ajinomoto brand Yakitori Chicken with Japanese-Style Fried Rice recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2016-05-07/eng/1462667105675/1462667109404">Food Recall Warning - Harmonie brand, IGA brand, Co-op brand, Western Family brand and unbranded frozen vegetable products recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2016-05-06/eng/1462587217154/1462587221070">Food Recall Warning - Cookin' Greens Organic brand A Blend of Kale, Sweet Corn &amp; Peas recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2016-05-06/eng/1462593110816/1462593113719">Food Recall Warning - Stahlbush Island Farms brand Cut Green Beans recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
				<p>And if we look into the last week of April we also get:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2016-04-23e/eng/1461458494788/1461458498163">Food Recall Warning - Organic by Nature brand frozen Organic Sweet Peas recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Needless to say, for the last two weeks Listeria has had a field day in Canada. The United States is not exempt! In what <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1022416727626">Juska et al (2003)</a> refer to as the &quot;amplification&quot; of food safety threats, or what Stericycle call the <a href="http://www.stericycleexpertsolutions.com/multiplier-effect-strikes/">&quot;multiplier effect&quot;</a>, listeria contamination from SunOpta Inc., a sunflower seed supplier has <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/05/sunflower-seed-listeria-threat-causes-recalls-of-salad-trail-mix/">resulted in a massive cascade of recalls across the United States</a>.<br>
			This series of recalls includes Sunflower Seed Snacks, trail mix, protein bars, Brown and Haley Chocolate snacks, and perhaps most stunningly 17 tons of Trader Joe's salad.</p>
			<p>Similarly, frozen vegetables from CRF Foods in Pasco Washington were recalled on <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm497297.htm">April 23rd</a> and subsequently expanded on <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm498841.htm">May 2</a> to include over 42 brands and 358 products (notably, just in time for Listeria Month!)</p>
			<p>It is rather stunning how far an error at a single supplier can reach in the contemporary food system. It almost seems as if we are reaching a level of consolidation and concentration in which the industry is too big to fail. The last two weeks has seen <em>tens of tons</em> of food pulled from the market and destroyed as a result of mistakes made by only a few companies... and this is only the beginning of Listeria Month!</p>
